# CNN-Classification-Model
Classification model based on CNN with different techniques like Image Augmentation and Transfer Learning to improve the overall accuracy and generalization ability of the model.The model was trained on the famous Cats vs Dogs dataset.

* First a basic CNN Model was on the dataset with 2 Convolution Layers and 2 MaxPooling layer.The model gave a Traning accuracy greater than 99% and test accuracy of 83% which clearly indicates that the model is **Overfitting**.

*  **Image augmentation** artificially creates training images through different ways of processing or combination of multiple processing, such as random rotation, shifts, shear and flips, etc.Since the previous was overfitting the training data, we can introduce **Image Augmentation** to increase variation in our dataset and decrease the generalzation error. 

* **Transfer learning (TL)** is a research problem in machine learning (ML) that focuses on storing knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem. For example, knowledge gained while learning to recognize cars could apply when trying to recognize trucks.
